## Overview
This is a vibrant, interactive multiplication table quiz app designed to make learning math more engaging and rewarding for children. The app features a playful theme, confetti effects, and a color-coded quiz container to help reinforce number groupings.  Vibe coded with psychological professional.

## ADHD-Friendly Features
Children with ADHD often benefit from immediate feedback, visual stimulation, and clear progress tracking. This app provides:

- **Instant Feedback:** Correct and incorrect answers are tracked and displayed, with confetti and sound effects for correct answers, making the experience more rewarding.
- **Scoreboard:** A live scoreboard shows the number and percentage of correct and wrong answers, helping children see their progress and stay motivated.
- **Reset Button:** Allows for quick restarts, supporting short attention spans and frequent breaks.
- **Visual Stimulation:** The quiz container uses color-coded backgrounds for each number group, making patterns and groupings easier to recognize and remember.
- **Grouping by Color:** Each multiplication group (e.g., 6x, 7x, etc.) is associated with a specific color in the quiz container, helping children visually connect similar numbers and build memory associations.

## How It Works
- The app presents multiplication questions up to 12x12.
- The first question is always 6x7, with a special sound effect for extra reward.
- Each question's group (the first number) determines the background color of the quiz container.
- Correct answers trigger confetti and positive sounds; wrong answers are tracked and can be revisited.
- The scoreboard updates in real time, and a reset button is available.

## Why Color Grouping?
Color grouping helps children, especially those with ADHD, visually organize information and recognize patterns. By associating each number group with a unique color, the app makes it easier to spot similarities, recall facts, and stay engaged.

## Getting Started
Open `index.html` in your browser. No installation required.

## Customization
You can easily adjust colors, sounds, and confetti images in the CSS and JS files to suit your child's preferences.
